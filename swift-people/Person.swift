////name, an immutable String,
//ageInYears, a mutable Int optional,
//skills, an empty mutable Array of Strings,
//qualifiedTutor, a calculated property of type Bool that, for now, simply returns false.

//internal visible method: a method that can only be seen within its scope of its class. So when we make a property private, that's the same as putting it into the .h file in Objective C.


//calculated property: to have something calculated when an object is called on. Whether it's math or interpolation.

    let name: String  //after you initialize a let property it is a readonly property. Before                      initialization, there's no memory allocated to it.
    
    //below are private properties set
    //the setter is private 
    // a property has a setter and getter - instance variables don't. 
    //a property and instance variable are the same thing. If you want to mess with the setter and getter. Set and Get are pieces that make it a property. Setter sets the value. Getter gets the value. 
    //When setting a private set, it's essentially unchangable and is like a let property. Nobody can set it. Setter is on the right side (the value) and the getter is the equal sign and what's it's assigned to.
    
    //private(set) var name: String (private set here) the ability to set on the property.
    // name = "susan"
    
    // Structs create copies. Classes has a reference and doesn't store the actual value.
    //each class should have its own file. The correct way is to have seperate files of your classes. 
    
    //setting a private class makes it inaccessable to other files.
    
    //private set means only class funcs can set it as something. Bc you want it only to be set with your methods. Like a GET count method, it's already set so you don't want anyone to change that and let it do it for you.
